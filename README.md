# FlexBus - Bus with us, Arrive on time
Welcome to our FlexBus - Smart Transportation project.

## âœ‹Introduction 

Since the last decade, an ever-growing traffic congestion has been a trauma for urban citizens. Public transportation has been proposed and implemented in the cities, but its overall impact is not as expected.
Having analyzed and researched on the reasons, we introduce FlexBus - an app aims to digitalize bus services and management.

## Technology Stack
* Front-end: React Native (Expo), NativeWind, and many complementary libaries provided by npm.
* Back-end: NestJS.
* Database: MongoDB, Mongoose ODM.
* Security: Session, JWT,..
* Monitor: SentryIO
* Build & Deployment: Expo Application Services (EAS), Github Actions, Expo OTA
* 3rd-party APIs: Google Places API, Here API
* Architecture Pattern: Model-View-Controller (MVC).

## ðŸŽ¯Features Built
### Guests Level
1. Location Finder: Guests can view location on the map. An autocomplete engine is integrated to improve UX.
2. Routes Finder: Guests can search route from A -> B on their demands. There will be alternative routes for users to choose from.
3. Bus Route Finder: Guests can view the time schedule and facilities for each bus route.

### Authorized User Level
1. Online Payment: Users can make a payment using their credit cards and digital wallet.
2. Transaction: Users can view their payment history. A QR/ Barcode will be attached for each transaction when clicked, and the bus conductor can scan the code to use it.
3. Profile: User can change their information and scan their Student Card to reduce ticket price for future transactions.
